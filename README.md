# STATIFY

[statify](https://statify-client.netlify.com) is a lightweight web app for viewing simple [Spotify](https://www.spotify.com/us/) listening statistics and trends. it is build using React and Plotly.js  and relies on an Node/Express server to handle authentication with Spotify's API, then retrieves and parses user listening data to show different aspects of a user's listening habits over varying lengths of time. the server is on heroku and likely sleeping so give her a moment to wake up when you do the auth step for the first time.
